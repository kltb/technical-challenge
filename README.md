# Validient Technical Challenge

In folder you'll find a minimal Vue project as you would see if you had set it up yourself. In the App.vue an example of how to import json and make it avaliable to the vue component.

Your tasks:

- Use a third party library to graph the number of trees planted with dates along the x axis
- Show a total of all trees planted in a set time range.
- 3 Month, 6 Month, and All Time buttons for displaying the data.
- A date picker to be able to select a time range.

You should give yourself 5 hours _maximum_ for this task. To submit your task, send a zip file of your solution to the info@validient.com email.

Please do **not** publicly host a repository of this code.

If you are struggling to set up the project please email as soon as possible, we are not testing your ability to set up your development environment.

If you read the vue documentation, make sure you read it for `vue 3`.

Good luck :)
